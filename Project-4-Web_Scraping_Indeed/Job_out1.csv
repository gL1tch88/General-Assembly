<li>Highly technical roles - Python, R, SQL</li>
<li>Excellent career progression available</li>

<br/>
My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>
<br/>

My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>
<br/>

My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>

My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>

<li>Highly technical roles - Python, R, SQL</li>
<li>Excellent career progression available</li>

<br/>
My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>
<br/>

My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>
<br/>

My client is a Financial Services organisation who continue to go from strength to strength with their innovative product suite and good governance enabling them to continue growing as we move into 2019. a truly data-driven business their Analytical &amp; Data Science team truly is at the heart of the business.
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning. The actuarial mindset and modelling skills is highly valued but the ideal candidate has this background but has then applied it to different analytical areas with large, unstructured data-sets where they have been able to innovate and use techniques such as machine learning etc. (e.g Sales Analytics, Online Analytics, Marketing Campaign Analytics etc.).<br/>
<br/>
This is an innovative Pricing team which works pretty much end to end in comparison with traditional pricing teams and they are continually looking to new technology/techniques (e.g. Machine Learning techniques, AI, Data Science/Big Data approaches) in order to innovate from a Pricing perspective and deliver a competitive advantage to the business.<br/>
<br/>
This isnt just pricing and Insurance related work though as you will work on advanced analytical projects across the business ( online analytics, sales analytics, marketing campaign analytics, media modelling, finance &amp; operational analytics) and be able to take a project and manage it end to end and deliver it. I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role. Analyst's must have strong commercial savvy &amp; be able to understand an organisation &amp; build relations internally.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships. With strong leadership which is well regarded in the industry this is an exciting time to be joining this function. With multiple roles available for the right candidate these opportunities offer successful applicants a very real chance to enjoy meaningful career progression over the next 2-5 years. The team is highly visible within the business where excellent work will get recognition from key people from a Senior Management level.<br/>
