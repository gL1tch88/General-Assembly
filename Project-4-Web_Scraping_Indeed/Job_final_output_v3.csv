Here, you'll collaborate with experienced and curious engineers to build the platform that powers Atlassian's Cloud products.

You will use your understanding of modern software design and architectural principles and your analytical skills to help future-proof our products and internal tooling. You'll contribute to the design, implementation, and operation of infrastructure components that are consumed by hundreds of microservices across Atlassian. You'll be able to take responsibility for the software you write from proof of concept through production: crafting software that can be monitored, defining shared operational boundaries, and writing documentation to help peers run your service.

Your experience with agile software development, unit testing, and continuous integration will be a huge asset on the team. Our team is always looking to innovate, so you'll have the chance to learn new languages, frameworks, and paradigms and propose novel solutions to emerging problems.

If you're excited to work in an environment that values a collaborative spirit over a hero attitude, we're excited to talk to you!

On your first day, we'll expect you to have:
Strong verbal and written communication
Analytical approach to problem solving
Desire to help others with their technical problems, big or small
Deep technical curiosity
Experience in one or more of Java or Python

Experience with AWS components such as RDS, DynamoDB, S3 and Cloudformation
Knowledge of container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos)
Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, Heroku) and applications built on cloud platforms.
MORE ABOUT THE ATLASSIAN PAAS TEAM:
At Atlassian, we build with our customers in mind. On the PaaS team, our customers are other Atlassians. That means that our team designs and supports core components that provide building blocks for running services, as well as infrastructure to ensure service owners can get the insights they need.

We get to collaborate with teams across Atlassian to understand their needs and greatest sources of pain, and help them get the most out of PaaS. That spans the gamut from design consultation and mentoring to facilitating internal workshops. The most successful members of our team successfully strike the right balance between setting good operational guidelines and helping developers be more efficient and innovative.

Because of our team's global nature, we feel comfortable working remotely from our teammates, and share the load when responding to incidents. Part of that global, rapid response involves a 24/7 on-call rotation.
