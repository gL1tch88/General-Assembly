We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.
About the Role

A successful strategy is essential to ANZs growth and financial contribution targets in 2020. The Strategy and Planning Associate will be responsible for creating actionable insights from the ground up, crafting strategies and tactics, and helping implement that plan across the region

The ideal candidate for this role will have strong analytical skills and an appetite for learning how data insights actually play out on the ground. They will need to navigate through stakeholders’ needs, be obsessed about making data-driven decisions and be super well organised. The position requires a strong ability to coordinate with multiple POCs across the business, manage relationships with functional areas and drive leadership buy-in.
What You'll Do:

Strategy

Help manage our regional P&L: In JUMP, there are a huge number of tradeoffs in the way that we make decisions (i.e. cost vs speed, deployment vs customer experience etc). You are key to helping drive to the right answer on those tradeoffs at a regional level. You need to know what data is needed and know how to present it to management in order to make the right call.
Intel & Insights generation: You will design methods to analyze market information, provide insights and shape strategies to guide JUMPs strategy in ANZ. Keep the team updated with competitive intel so we can stay ahead of the pack.

Planning

Planning: Planning in JUMP is very different to what is required in other parts of Uber. You need to understand hardware development, supply chains and certification timelines amongst others in order to help devise a workable plan for the region.
Organisation: You will then need to help manage the implementation of that plan. Because we operate hardware, there are more dependencies required over a longer period of time in order to implement our plan or strategy. You will be a centrepoint for coordinating efforts of the team and ensure these dependencies are all working in unison.

Prioritization: In Jump/NeMo we are never at a shortage of problems to tackle or projects to take on. You will need to be a strong influencer to ensure the team prioritizes the most impactful work first while not letting long term issues fall out of thought.

What You'll Need:

4+ years of work experience, preferably in Consulting, Business Intelligence, Investment Banking, is expected, but we'll evaluate candidates with less experience if they meet our other requirements
Top of the line Excel and data management skills
You need to be very well organised and have good project management skills
You will need to thrive with ambiguity and uncertainty. You need to be able to create order and a path forward when the answer isn’t clear.
SQL proficiency is a requirement, Python and R knowledge are a huge plus
Strong communication skills is a must - Taking complicated and complex issues and compiling into a clean and clear narrative. You will need to be able to influence the thinking of those above you as well as your peers
Strong business sense and creative approach with data to identify gaps in our value proposition
You need to be a self starter. There is lots of ‘white space’ in JUMP and you will need to know how to prioritise what work needs to be done and what doesn’t."

Welcome!

We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.

Then & Now

Our story ( https://envato.com/blog/the-story-of-envato/ ) starts in 2006 with three founders in a Sydney garage (no, we're not kidding). Born from a desire to earn a living doing what they loved, with the flexibility ( https://envato.com/blog/flexibility-at-the-heart-of-life-at-envato/ ) to do it from anywhere, Envato set out to create an online community for buying and selling creative digital assets. Nearly 13 years later, we're profitable and still totally bootstrapped. This allows us to stay experimental and totally focused on the best interests of our authors & customers around the world.

We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ). Every day, these products continue to help everyone from freelancers to small business owners and agencies get their creative projects done.

While we are known and loved within the digital professional community globally, where our authors have earned over $750 million ( http://press.envato.com/172514-envato-closes-in-on-1-billion-usd-in-community-earnings ), we also want to be a place where anyone can Make with Envato.

With over 600 people globally, we have offices in Guadalajara, Mexico ( https://envato.com/blog/placeit-joins-envato/ ) & Los Angeles ( https://envato.com/blog/twenty20-joins-the-envato-family/ ), alongside our funky Melbourne HQ. We pride ourselves on being remote friendly, with a staffing population just as diverse as the global community that use our products. To keep this sustainable as we scale, we support people to work from anywhere, whether that's the beach in Croatia, on the Mornington Peninsula, or from their living room.

Initially the role will focus of building a number of much needed simple Tableau reports. As through you get to better know the business and stakeholders and the tech stack and data, the role will become more forward thinking, building dashboards to enable a self service culture, and even being able to create insights the business may not realise they're able to access.

This PhD project will specifically aim to develop novel spatial modelling and decision theoretic approaches to integrate data on pests, management effectiveness, and management actions available to different Queensland Government agencies. Then to use this to evaluate spatial priorities for the different agencies given their differing objectives.

This PhD will be part of a team including a soon to be appointed Post-Doctoral Fellow, Associate Professors Eve McDonald-Madden and Jonathan Rhodes (UQ), Associate Professor Michael Bode (QUT), Dr Geoff Lundie-Jenkins (Qld Parks and Wildlife Service), and Dr Olusegun Osunkoya (Biosecurity Qld), and a second PhD student at QUT.

We’re not like other banks.


ME was created by the industry super funds to be different from the pack – and we’re passionate about staying that way as we head into an exciting and progressive future.


We are building a bank, a company and a brand that we can be proud of – but to achieve that, we need the best people. To help ME get there, you’ll challenge the status quo and share extraordinary ideas – and our size guarantees you’ll have the opportunity, support, and environment to be heard.


ME’s core purpose is helping all Australians get ahead – no conditions, asterisks or exceptions.


We believe everyone deserves the same opportunities in life, regardless of gender or identity, sexuality, ethnicity, disability or religion. This is why we’re so committed to an equal opportunity workplace – because we know our success won’t come from focusing on similarities, but by embracing and celebrating our diversity


About the role


As part of the Digital and Integration team, you’ll take part in the customisation, integration, deployment and operation of our Online Banking platform. You’ll put your extensive skills to good use by assisting to scope system change requirements, assist with troubleshooting, issue resolution and providing support to ensure the smooth operation of our digital channels. While there’s no development within this role, you’d need to have experience with DevOps, cloud and automated deployments so you know how to debug issues as they arise.


This role will also see you manage code releases, troubleshooting, help with system change requirements and liaising with vendors and stakeholders right across the business, as well as configuration, investigation and automating deployments. It’s a very high impact and hands on role, so if you enjoy rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck into it, while bringing your passion and innovation to try out new ideas, this could be a perfect opportunity for you.


About you


You are highly skilled and have solid experience in Java (version 7 onwards) have a background in working within an agile delivery team, and prior experience in providing support within financial services. Having used applications such as SQL Server RDBMS and SQL problem solving & scripting and supporting solutions across windows servers (and the BankFast platform) it will certainly put you ahead of the rest.


With your previous exposure to scripting and deployment automation (processing, building and deployments) with Powershell and Python languages, Cloud experience (AWS is preferred) and knowledge about infrastructure, you’re ready to step up and start the new year with a brand new role working within the exciting team at ME.


I want those Converse shoes (and the role)


Can’t see a closing date on the advert? That’s because we’re pretty efficient here at ME and we may start looking at applications sooner rather than later, so if this role sounds like your jam, be sure to apply by submitting your CV today.


Should an applicant be the preferred candidate, background checks (including police checks, reference checks, ASIC banned and disqualified persons and bankruptcy checks) will be completed prior to the candidate's employment being confirmed. The outcomes of the background checks do not automatically bar candidates; however, will be assessed against the inherent requirements of the job."
