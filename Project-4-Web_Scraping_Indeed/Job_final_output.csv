About You
<br/>You relish a fast-paced, dynamic environment - in fact, some of your best work has been completed under pressure. You have brilliant technical skills but you're also a keen collaborator who can partner with a range of team members to work collaboratively across the organisation. You will have experience working with excel and SQL databases and be a great problem solver. You have an enquiring mind that lets you analyse data quickly and effectively, and your outstanding communication skills mean you can convey your findings to a wide range of colleagues.
<br/><br/>
<b>Your experience and skills should include most, if not all:</b><br/>
Extensive experience working directly with users, helping them understand how to harness the power of business intelligence, and efficiently build prototypes to demonstrate dashboard and reporting requests through data modelling, designing, and implementing a data warehouse.
<br/>Excellent communication and interpersonal skills with the ability to foster positive business relationships
<br/>Tertiary qualifications in a commercial or quantitative discipline (for example Statistics, Mathematics, IT, Computer Science, or Business)
<br/>Data modelling excel and SQL skills, with 3+ years' experience in performing complex source and target data analysis
<br/>ETL tool experience (e.g SSIS or the like) - for loading/transforming excel spreadsheets into relational tables
<br/>In the 'nice to have' category we have experience with ERPs and ERP Migrations. Experience as a Business Analyst would also be an advantage, as would experience working on M&amp;A projects. It is however your experience in analytics plus your interpersonal skill set, values and drive, that will ultimately make you the right fit for this role.

If you’ve been working in the travel industry you’d already know who the APT Travel Group is, but if you haven’t we’d love to introduce ourselves. ATG was founded when a member of the McGeary family identified an opportunity back in the 1920’s. When the cable tram drivers in Melbourne’s northern suburbs went on extended strike, Bill McGeary converted his truck into a bus and began ferrying commuters from the tram starved suburb of Northcote to the train terminus in Clifton Hill. Fast forward 92 years and ATG is now a global business with an extensive portfolio of cruising and touring; and although we’ve rapidly grown and diversified over those 92 years ATG still maintains that family feel, however is big enough for you to explore your potential and really influence change.</p>

We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.</div>
<div><b>About the Role</b></div><div></div><br/>
<div>
A successful strategy is essential to ANZs growth and financial contribution targets in 2020. The Strategy and Planning Associate will be responsible for creating actionable insights from the ground up, crafting strategies and tactics, and helping implement that plan across the region</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
The ideal candidate for this role will have strong analytical skills and an appetite for learning how data insights actually play out on the ground. They will need to navigate through stakeholders’ needs, be obsessed about making data-driven decisions and be super well organised. The position requires a strong ability to coordinate with multiple POCs across the business, manage relationships with functional areas and drive leadership buy-in.</div><div></div><br/>
<div><b>What You'll Do:</b></div><div></div><br/>
<div><b>
Strategy</b></div><div></div><br/>
<ul><li><b>
Help manage our regional P&amp;L:</b> In JUMP, there are a huge number of tradeoffs in the way that we make decisions (i.e. cost vs speed, deployment vs customer experience etc). You are key to helping drive to the right answer on those tradeoffs at a regional level. You need to know what data is needed and know how to present it to management in order to make the right call.</li><li><b>
Intel &amp; Insights generation</b>: You will design methods to analyze market information, provide insights and shape strategies to guide JUMPs strategy in ANZ. Keep the team updated with competitive intel so we can stay ahead of the pack.<br/>
</li></ul><p><b>
Planning</b></p><div></div><br/>
<ul><li><b>
Planning: </b>Planning in JUMP is very different to what is required in other parts of Uber. You need to understand hardware development, supply chains and certification timelines amongst others in order to help devise a workable plan for the region.</li></ul><ul><li>
Organisation: You will then need to help manage the implementation of that plan. Because we operate hardware, there are more dependencies required over a longer period of time in order to implement our plan or strategy. You will be a centrepoint for coordinating efforts of the team and ensure these dependencies are all working in unison.</li></ul><div></div><br/>
<ul><li><b>
Prioritization</b>: In Jump/NeMo we are never at a shortage of problems to tackle or projects to take on. You will need to be a strong influencer to ensure the team prioritizes the most impactful work first while not letting long term issues fall out of thought.<br/>
</li></ul><div><b>
What You'll Need:</b></div><div></div><br/>
<ul><li>
4+ years of work experience, preferably in Consulting, Business Intelligence, Investment Banking, is expected, but we'll evaluate candidates with less experience if they meet our other requirements</li><li>
Top of the line Excel and data management skills</li><li>
You need to be very well organised and have good project management skills</li><li>
You will need to thrive with ambiguity and uncertainty. You need to be able to create order and a path forward when the answer isn’t clear.</li><li>
SQL proficiency is a requirement, Python and R knowledge are a huge plus</li><li>
Strong communication skills is a must - Taking complicated and complex issues and compiling into a clean and clear narrative. You will need to be able to influence the thinking of those above you as well as your peers</li><li>
Strong business sense and creative approach with data to identify gaps in our value proposition</li><li>
You need to be a self starter. There is lots of ‘white space’ in JUMP and you will need to know how to prioritise what work needs to be done and what doesn’t.</li></ul></div></div></div>",,

Initially the role will focus of building a number of much needed simple Tableau reports.

<br/><br/>
( http://www.envato.com/careers/open-jobs )
<br/><br/>
Welcome!
<br/><br/>
We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.
<br/><br/>
Then &amp; Now
<br/><br/>
Our story ( https://envato.com/blog/the-story-of-envato/ ) starts in 2006 with three founders in a Sydney garage (no, we're not kidding). Born from a desire to earn a living doing what they loved, with the flexibility ( https://envato.com/blog/flexibility-at-the-heart-of-life-at-envato/ ) to do it from anywhere, Envato set out to create an online community for buying and selling creative digital assets. Nearly 13 years later, we're profitable and still totally bootstrapped. This allows us to stay experimental and totally focused on the best interests of our authors &amp; customers around the world.
<br/><br/>
We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ). Every day, these products continue to help everyone from freelancers to small business owners and agencies get their creative projects done.
<br/><br/>
While we are known and loved within the digital professional community globally, where our authors have earned over $750 million ( http://press.envato.com/172514-envato-closes-in-on-1-billion-usd-in-community-earnings ), we also want to be a place where anyone can Make with Envato. Alongside Market &amp; Elements, our portfolio also includes Milkshake ( https://milkshake.app/ ), a website builder for Instagrammers, Placeit ( https://placeit.net/ ), a smart template tool for logos, mockups, graphic design &amp; more, Mixkit ( https://mixkit.co/ ), for free stock footage and animation, and most recently, Twenty20 ( https://www.twenty20.com/ ), a stock-photo subscription service.
<br/><br/>
With over 600 people globally, we have offices in Guadalajara, Mexico ( https://envato.com/blog/placeit-joins-envato/ ) &amp; Los Angeles ( https://envato.com/blog/twenty20-joins-the-envato-family/ ), alongside our funky Melbourne HQ. We pride ourselves on being remote friendly, with a staffing population just as diverse as the global community that use our products.

About this Opportunity</b></h3>
<p>
The management of invasive pests is complicated because they are often managed by multiple agencies with different objectives.

This exciting PhD project aims to develop spatial approaches to modelling pest management for multiple agencies using Queensland as a case study. This PhD project will specifically aim to develop novel spatial modelling and decision theoretic approaches to integrate data on pests, management effectiveness, and management actions available to different Queensland Government agencies. Then to use this to evaluate spatial priorities for the different agencies given their differing objectives.</p>
