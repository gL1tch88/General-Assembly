<br/>The Role
<br/>The data analyst role is critical to providing data and business insights across the organisation. Reporting to the Lead Data Analyst, you will become an integral member of the project implementation team, responsible for the cleansing, translating and extracting of data from legacy sources into defined excel template structures, allowing for importing of data into the target ERP database.
<br/><br/>
<b>Key responsibilities include:</b><br/>
Working directly with users to understand a legacy system with incomplete data, and helping them understand how to harness the power of business intelligence and better scope their future needs.
<br/>Perform source system data analysis to map data objects between the legacy ERP system and other data inputs to the target ERP and/or spreadsheet templates;
<br/>Create complex scripts to extract required data from the source legacy ERP financial system, spreadsheets, and other disparate databases;
<br/>Compare and transform extracted data with existing target ERP records, to match and map old and new identifiers;
<br/>Create exception logs/reports to proactively identify errors/mismatched data types in source or target systems allowing for timely corrections and re-validations as required; and
<br/>Document the end-state extraction steps and checks to ensure the data migration process is repeatable and tested to ensure smooth cutover during the go-live process.
<br/><br/>
About You
<br/>You relish a fast-paced, dynamic environment - in fact, some of your best work has been completed under pressure. You have brilliant technical skills but you're also a keen collaborator who can partner with a range of team members to work collaboratively across the organisation. You will have experience working with excel and SQL databases and be a great problem solver. You have an enquiring mind that lets you analyse data quickly and effectively, and your outstanding communication skills mean you can convey your findings to a wide range of colleagues.
<br/><br/>
<b>Your experience and skills should include most, if not all:</b><br/>
Extensive experience working directly with users, helping them understand how to harness the power of business intelligence, and efficiently build prototypes to demonstrate dashboard and reporting requests through data modelling, designing, and implementing a data warehouse.
<br/>Excellent communication and interpersonal skills with the ability to foster positive business relationships
<br/>Tertiary qualifications in a commercial or quantitative discipline (for example Statistics, Mathematics, IT, Computer Science, or Business)
<br/>Data modelling excel and SQL skills, with 3+ years' experience in performing complex source and target data analysis
<br/>ETL tool experience (e.g SSIS or the like) - for loading/transforming excel spreadsheets into relational tables
<br/>In the 'nice to have' category we have experience with ERPs and ERP Migrations. Experience as a Business Analyst would also be an advantage, as would experience working on M&amp;A projects. It is however your experience in analytics plus your interpersonal skill set, values and drive, that will ultimately make you the right fit for this role.

<div><b>About the Role</b></div><div></div><br/>
<div>
Each State and Territory in Australia &amp; New Zealand (ANZ) is subject to different and complex ridesharing regulations. You will be responsible for ensuring that Uber ANZ’s 100,000+ driver-partners are fully compliant with local regulations in the nine (9) markets in which Uber ANZ operates, and for identifying and operationalizing ways to improve outcomes for Uber, our driver-partners, and our local regulators.</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
In this critical Rides Operations role you will be leading the central function that is responsible for a large portion of overall budget, helping drive faster growth and more efficiency through centralised processes. This role will work across many functions and teams in the ANZ region, with global Marketplace counterparts and with Uber HQ in San Francisco.<br/>
<br/>
This role is a unique opportunity to help further develop and enforce our global driver and delivery partner access criteria and assurance framework. This data-driven role calls for a rare combination of analytical thinking, strong interpersonal abilities and experience in large scale project management.</div><div></div><br/>
<div><b>What You’ll Do:</b></div><div>
</div><ul><li>
Be the owner of core processes that maintain our driver-partner’s regulatory compliance</li><li>

BA/BS/Masters in Finance, Economics, Business, Engineering, or other</li><li>
An analytical approach - the ability to seek out and analyse data to back-up sound recommendations (SQL experience preferred)</li><li>
Clear communication skills - you are a clear and concise communicator with the ability to synthesise a lot of information quickly, highlight the key take-aways, and disseminate actionable insights</li><li>
Balance attention to detail with swift execution - we need to do things quickly, and we need to do them well. Balancing those can be challenging, and this should be a strength.</li><li>
Explorer - the ability to self-serve, investigate and get the data we require will make you much more effective in this role. Self-starter attitude is a must!</li><li>
Be incredibly truth-seeking with data, set a high bar for the team to think boldly and creatively, communicate frequently and with high quality; then funnel that energy into concrete processes and execution plans</li><li>

If you’ve been working in the travel industry you’d already know who the APT Travel Group is, but if you haven’t we’d love to introduce ourselves. ATG was founded when a member of the McGeary family identified an opportunity back in the 1920’s.

Fast forward 92 years and ATG is now a global business with an extensive portfolio of cruising and touring; and although we’ve rapidly grown and diversified over those 92 years ATG still maintains that family feel, however is big enough for you to explore your potential and really influence change.</p>

<br/>
I am looking for Analysts with Actuarial related qualifications and ideally some experience in this space but the main requirement is really good experience as an Analyst including strong technical skills (R, Python) &amp; experience with large data-sets &amp; experience with Machine Learning.

I am looking for practical analyst's, who can impact on the business and deliver applied analytics. Being able to take a problem with incomplete data-sets and fashion a solution, deliver an outcome, solve a problem, add value etc. is the critical component for this role.

<br/>
This is an excellent role within a team with a strong and supportive culture. This is a high performance team where what you deliver will be measured along with your ability (in the fullness of time) to suggest process improvements as well as the quality of your stakeholder relationships.
