 ### Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0, 1, 2 or 3). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project **requirements:** 

 Score | Expectations
 ----- | ------------
 **0** | _Did not complete. Try again._
 **1** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again_
 **2** | _Meets expectations._
 **3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_
 
 ### Project 4 feedback
| Requirement | Rubric   |
|------|------|
|   Scrape and prepare your own data  | 3|
|   Create and compare at least two models, one a decision tree or ensemble and the other a classifier or regression for Section 1: Job Salary Trends and Section 2: Job Category Factors (so at least 4 models in total)  | 3|
|   Polished Jupyter notebook with your analysis annotated for a peer audience of data scientists  | 3|
|  Executive summary at the beginning of your notebook for written for your superiors to use to make business decisions. Make sure that it includes the ‘So what…’ regarding your analysis, risks and limitations. |3|
|   BONUS: Explain the tradeoffs between detecting high versus low salary positions  | 3|

__Qualitative feedback:__ 

Very impressive scraping and modelling, Mark. In this project you have
demonstrated that the ability to implement complex data acquisition and
modelling processes which is an important core skill that will continue to
develop as you tackle more real world scenarios. As you outlined in your
presentation having the discipline to save the useful data from scrapes as you
go allowing you to learn and build from each iteration of your code. Compared to
previous presentations you were more relaxed in your delivery, what were the
aspects of the previous presentations that helped? Focusing on your strengths is
important, however, use the time remaining in the course to practice the
aspects that you find more difficult, for example modelling and business outcomes.
Well done. :)
